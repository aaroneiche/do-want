=======

Do Want is an Open Source Gift Registry system designed to be quick and easy to setup and run on your preferred web
server. 

Whether you're exchanging gifts with just one other person or with 50 other people, Do Want makes it easy to pick out 
gifts and make sure no one else ends up with the same thing.
