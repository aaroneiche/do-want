Do-Want
=======

Do Want is an Open Source Gift Registry system designed to be quick and easy to setup and run on your preferred web
server. 

Whether you're exchanging gifts with just one other person or with 50 other people, Do Want makes it easy to pick out 
gifts and make sure no one else ends up with the same thing.

Looking for a Download?
=======================

If you just want to download an installable, reasonably stable version, you can visit the [end-user-friendly page here](http://aaroneiche.github.com/do-want/)

Most recent update
==================
Just added support for adding and deleting categories at your whim. Items with that category now move to a "none" category, which is a valid option.
Also some minor bug fixes.

What's on the Docket?
=====================
Things that we're planning on having done for a version 1.0 release:
- Self-updating - Do Want will be able to check for updates, download, unpack, and install both files and Database updates
- Improvements in UI - The unification of the item detail and edit screens are high on the list, and better item creation.
- Better user notifications & management.
- Getting rid of all those annoying bugs that everyone hates.
