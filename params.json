{"name":"Do-want","tagline":"Do Want - Open Source Gift Registry","body":"Do-Want\r\n=======\r\n\r\nDo Want is an Open Source Gift Registry system designed to be quick and easy to setup and run on your preferred web\r\nserver. \r\n\r\nWhether you're exchanging gifts with just one other person or with 50 other people, Do Want makes it easy to pick out \r\ngifts and make sure no one else ends up with the same thing.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n========\r\nThe Download links at the top of this page are the source releases. You can use them, but if you want to go easy on yourself, you should [download this file](https://github.com/aaroneiche/do-want/releases/download/0.9.97/do-want-0.9.97.zip). Then you can follow *The Preferred Way* in the installation instructions below.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n####The preferred way\r\n\r\nDownload the most recent version from the link above and go to the directory where you placed it in your browser. You will be redirected to the installation page.\r\n\r\n####The alternative way\r\nIf you would prefer to use the most recent code (at your own risk), or at least the most recent code committed, you can download the code on the github (https://github.com/aaroneiche/do-want) This version is not guaranteed to work properly, though the code should be relatively complete.\r\n\r\nYou will need to have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/), Then do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomposer install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will make composer fetch all the appropriate files \r\nAdditionally, you will need to install a customized version of the Phinx TextWrapper Class [found here](https://github.com/aaroneiche/phinx/tree/0.5.x-dev/src/Phinx/Wrapper) - this version supports seed commands from php applications. Simply replace the corrosponding file in your vendor/robmorgan/phinx/src/Wrapper/ with the new one. A pull request is into the Phinx project to get the file updated.\r\n\r\n\r\nMigrating from a previous version\r\n=================================\r\nThere are two steps necessary to migrate from a previous installation of DoWant. This is a temporary solution while a more elegant process is put into place. \r\n\r\n1) Copy all new files from the distribution to your installation. Many FTP programs have a sync feature that will accomplish this. Be sure to not overwrite your **uploads** directory, or your **custom** directory - if you're using it.\r\n\r\n2) Update your database; In your browser, go to your wishlist and to /migrator.php  Here you will find a table of migrations - simply click on the last available one. This will migrate your installation to the most recent database version. After that, you're done!\r\n\r\nSocial Login\r\n============\r\nSocial Login is an advanced configuration feature that allows login with (currently) Google or Facebook instead of using DoWant's internal login system (a native user is still generated).\r\nDocumentation is being generated, but it's currently incomplete.\r\nA knowledge of PHP is helpful in setting the values, but it should be pretty easy to figure out.\r\n\r\nHere's a short version':\r\n\r\n####For Both\r\n - Copy ```authconf.default.php``` to ```authconf.php```\r\n - Change the ```base_url``` value to ```http://yourDomainName.tld/hybrid.php``` (replacing the domain)\r\n\r\n####Then For Google\r\n - Go to Googles Developer Console\r\n - Create an Application\r\n - Enable the Google+ API on it\r\n - Create Credentials (Id/Secret)\r\n - Add the authorized URL: ```http://yourdomain.tld/hybrid.php?hauth.done=Google``` (replacing the domain)\r\n\r\n\r\n####Then For Facebook\r\n - Go to the [Facebook Developers Page](https://developers.facebook.com/)\r\n - Create an Application\r\n - Go to Settings\r\n - Add your domain to the \"domains\".\r\n - \r\n\r\n####Then For Both\r\n - Add your client secret and client ID to the relavant section\r\n - Set enabled to ```true``` (no quotes)\r\n - Save your ```authconf.php``` file\r\n\r\nReload the site, you should now see the buttons for logging in on the login panel.\r\nIf you can't get it to work, feel free to post to [the developers group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/do-want) You should get a pretty quick response.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\nIf you're willing to contribute, I'm delighted to have you work on it! The workflow is pretty simple:\r\n\t\r\n\t1) Fork the \"develop\" branch (it's the default)\r\n\t2) Create a branch to fix an issue, or implement a feature\r\n\t3) Write code (pull 'develop' and merge it into your branch as you go to stay up to date)\r\n\t4) Push that branch to your Github\r\n\t5) Issue a pull request to the develop branch\r\n\r\nI'm still figuring out unit testing, and the release cycle. I figure once we tackle a few bugs, we'll merge into master and \r\ntag a release.\r\n\r\nFeel free to email with questions, comments, concerns, or ideas: aaron@aaroneiche.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
